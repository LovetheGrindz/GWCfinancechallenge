          Hello!! My name is Brianna and I am a High Schooler interested in
          computer science. As someone who struggles with financial decisions
          myself, I decided to make an AI tool idea that uses AI algorithm to
          produce content depending on an individual's needs. I came up with the
          tool "Smart Funds" to help those in multiple areas like debt and
          investment. In the future, I hope an algorithm like this is created to
          help not only me but those who lack financial literacy. ☺

        <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
        <h3>
          How does your project use AI to help people with their finances in a
          way that hasn't been done before?
        </h3>
        <p>
          &emsp; As stated in the previous sections, Smart Funds takes
          individuals past transactions and generates budgeting plans to cater
          to one's goals. Along with that, those with student loans or credit
          card debt can create payment plans that fit within their budget while
          still affording necessities. Because this tool is personalized, the
          use of AI is crucial by taking other's experiences and advice from
          financial advisors to give individuals effective financial
          advice/plans. To add on, AI is a tool that need to be fed information
          and can expand over time, leading to better responses. The constantly
          updated advice will allow users to keep up with the market (important
          for investors) which can more accessible to wider audience. AI has not
          been utilized in these areas, at least to this extent specifically
          towards individuals. Financial AI generated tools gravitate towards
          companies at the moment, but reaching individuals is important to
          improve financial literacy along with effective budgeting.

        <h3>
          Describe a challenge you faced. How did you overcome it? How did you
          reach out for help?
        </h3>
        <p>
          &emsp; During this project, I endured a plethora of adversities one of
          which was sizing. I had made my project using the measurement root em
          for every element. However when I tested my website on mobile, the
          sizing was off and I had to redo almost every page. After watching
          tutorials and looking at online forms, I was able to fix my page after
          a couple of days. I do not know others around me who make websites so
          I felt alone in this process.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What did you learn from this process that will impact the way you
          interact with technology in the future?
        </h3>
        <p>
          &emsp; As stated before, I had no help with this website except stack
          overflow and other platforms. This was my first ever website I created
          using html, let alone css. I had to learn css and some html to have a
          layout and spend hours getting it the way I wanted. In the future, I
          will try not to jump into projects with no background and test the
          language with small activities to understand future projects better.
          This way, I'll get the best results and hopefully have those around me
          to help.
        </p>
        <h3>Why did you choose this format for your project?</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp; I knew sooner or later I will need to make a website so I
          decided to make one displaying what a AI finance tool would look like.
          I found that this will introduce myself into html and css that can be
          later used for other projects. Overall, I enjoyed this challenge even
          with its ups and downs and would choose to make a website again if I
          had the choice to.
